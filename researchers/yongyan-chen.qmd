# Who am I

Hi I am Yongyan Chen. I came from China and started my phd at December 2019. My research focus is on the usefulness of lactation curve modelling.

# What project I am working on

There are four chapters in my phd thesis:

-   A procedure to develop annual herd level lactation curve characteristics from individual cow level data for Dutch dairy farms
-   An empirical analysis of economic herd performance in relation to herd lactation curve characteristics
-   Prediction of persistency at day 305 in lactation at the moment of the insemination decision
-   Association between pregnancy stage and lactation persistency in dairy cattle
