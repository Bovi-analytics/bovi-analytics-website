## Current position

**Robert and Anne Everett Associate Professor of Digital Dairy Management and Data Analytics** at Department of Animal Science, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Cornell University (9 months position) and at Department of Laboratory for Animal Nutrition and Animal Product Quality (0.1 FTE -- Ghent University) focusing on the creation of methodologies using precision dairy farming to monitor sustainable food production systems from a global perspective.

## Biographical sketch

***Miel Hostens*** received his MSc in Veterinary Medicine at the Ghent University (Belgium) in 2006 and was awarded his PhD in Veterinary Medicine in 2012. His profound interest in dairy science is heavily supported by an active attendance to multiple national and international dairy science conferences between 2007 and 2023. Quickly after his appointment at the department of Reproduction, Obstetrics and Herd Health in 2007, he developed a strong personal vision around the need for more data-driven dairy science through research and industry collaborations. Starting in the early days of his PhD in 2007, he successfully finished several post-graduate educations in the epidemiological, statistical and data science domain. He finished a professional certificate in Epidemiology (Prince Edward Island, 2009) and Bioinformatics (Dublin, 2016). Next to graduate students in Veterinary Medicine, he supervised undergraduate and graduate students in Computer Science and Bio-informatics. To further deepen his data science expertise, he enrolled in a MSc in Computational Statistics in 2016 and finished 45 ECTS credits. After he finished his PhD in 2013, a prototype of an analytical data pipeline and data warehouse architecture he had developed during his PhD was acquired by Delaval, one of the largest milking equipment manufacturers in the world which was subsequently merged into DairyDataWarehouse.com. The data-driven expertise he developed accelerated involvement in several research and industry projects (see below). He has attracted multiple projects on data-driven agriculture and precision dairy farming overseas. The unique combination of data and dairy science in an academic profile was the main reason for attracting him as **Associate Professor of Digital Dairy Management and Data Analytics** in January 2024 at the Department of Animal Science at Cornell University. His lab focusses on developing a data-driven dairy science eventually contributing to sustainable food production systems from a global perspective.

## Motivational insights

Understanding what somebody does often starts by understanding one's motivational insights. [You can read my motivational insights](/files/pdfs/miel-hostens-insights.pdf) (created in 2022, I might have changed a little bit meanwhile :). Most of the ideas in the report can be found in the absolutely must-read "[Surrounded by Idiots](https://www.surroundedbyidiots.com/en/books/surrounded-by-idiots/)" by Thomas Erikson. His book and my own motivational insights have been a personal and academic game changer for me.

## Education

-   PhD in Veterinary Medicine, University of Ghent, 2013:

| GplusE was an FP7 project funded by the European Union. It was a five-year project from 2014 and 2018 executed by 15 research and industry partners. The project covered the interaction between genotype and environment contributing to the sustainability of dairy cow production systems. This was achieved through the optimal integration of genomic selection and novel management protocols based on the development and exploitation of genomic data and supporting novel phenotyping approaches.                               | CoPI                   | 2014                   | €9,000,000               |

| In the SUMMERFAIR project (SUMmarizing transmission data to Enable data Reanalysis and predictions by FAIR data use) we tackle the issue of lack of a common terminology and need for repetition of costly experiments by developing a shared vocabulary (domain-ontology) and a workflow enabling reuse and combination of transmission data. The project running from 2021-2022 was granted by the dutch ZoNMW.                                                                                                                        | CoPI                   | 2021                   | €250,000                 |

| VEERKRACHT/Resilience – The transition period as a window and metabolic resilience to monitor of dairy cattle, granted by national Belgian VLAIO 2018 is a project that aims at creating tools to monitor the transition success of dairy cows at individual level and herd level. These tools allow the farmer to monitor individual animals at risk, in addition to allow individualized preventive measures. This will reduce the development of transition associated problems, which will increase productivity and animal welfare. | CoPI                   | 2018                   | €1,300,000               |

## Intellectual property and knowledge transfer

In 2013, intellectual property created by my group on data processing and visualisation for dairy reproduction data, co-developed between Uniform-Agri (Assen, the Netherlands) and Ghent University, was transferred towards [www.DairyDataWarehouse.com](http://www.DairyDataWarehouse.com) (2007-2013). Dairy Data Warehouse nowadays is a specialist dairy data company providing digital solutions for a sustainable, profitable future for dairy farmers and stakeholders throughout the dairy industry.
