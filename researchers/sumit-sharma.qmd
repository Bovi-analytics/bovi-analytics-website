### Who am I:
![](/files/img/headshots/Sumit_Sharma.jpg){fig-align="right" width="100"}

Hi! I am Sumit, an incoming PhD student at CALS, Cornell. I am a veterinarian with a Master of Veterinary Science (M.V.Sc.) in Physiology and a B.V.Sc. & A.H. (equivalent to DVM) from the Agriculture and Forestry University (AFU), Nepal.
Over time, and coming from a veterinary background, my interests have gradually expanded to the intersection of animal health and production, data science, and digital dairy systems, leading me to develop a growing curiosity for programming and analytical tools. I find working with data both challenging and rewarding; translating complexity into clarity. I am especially drawn to how emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning can drive smarter, more sustainable approaches to livestock management.
Outside of research, I enjoy being in nature, trying new sports, following whatever catches my curiosity, and learning music at my own pace. Whether itâ€™s playing football or ping pong, discussing world affairs, or picking up a new tune, I like to keep life active, creative, and open to new experiences.


### My work at Bovi-Analytics

At Bovi-Analytics, I focus on applying AI and machine learning to precision livestock farming, turning complex data into practical insights. I am also exploring and learning about a wide range of approaches, including data quality assessment, simulation and digital twin models, and computer vision etc.
