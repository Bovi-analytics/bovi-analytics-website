# Who am I

Hi I am Saba Noor. I came from Pakistan and started my phd at Feburay 2023. My research focus is on Ontology driven animal health -- a prerequisite towards federated learning.

# What project I am working on

As a PhD student I'm working on Decide project Work Package 1. The objective of the DECIDE project, funded by the European Horizon 2020 initiative, is to create decision-support tools that enhance the management of infectious diseases in livestock and aquaculture. DECIDE's focus revolves around respiratory and gastrointestinal syndromes in swine, poultry, and cattle, along with addressing growth reduction in salmons. The project's core activities encompass pinpointing stakeholder requirements, gathering pertinent data, evaluating disease prevalence and control expenses, setting up early warning mechanisms, and comprehending the holistic disease impact. The primary goal of DECIDE's early warning system is to furnish timely, pivotal information to stakeholders, notably farmers and veterinarians. This empowers them to judiciously determine disease-mitigating measures. Detecting signals at an early stage enables stakeholders to take proactive steps in preventing or managing the spread of diseases, thereby minimizing their impact on animal health and welfare.
