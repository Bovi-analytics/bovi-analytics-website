::: {.schedule-page}

Here's your roadmap for the semester!

- [**Content**](/content/) ({{< fa book-open-reader >}}): This page contains the readings, slides, and recorded lectures for the week. Read and watch these **before** our in-person class.
- [**Example**](/example/) ({{< fa laptop-code >}}): This page contains fully annotated R code and other supplementary information that you can use as a reference for your assignments and project. This is only a reference pageâ€”you don't have to necessarily do anything here. Some sections also contain videos of me live coding the examples so you can see what it looks like to work with R in real time. This page will be *very* helpful as you work on your assignments.
- [**Assignment**](/assignment/) ({{< fa pen-ruler >}}): This page contains the instructions for each assignment. Weekly reports are due by *noon* on the day of class. Other assignments are due by *11:59 PM* on the day they're listed.

withr::with_dir(here::here(), {
  schedule_nested <- targets::tar_read(schedule_page_data)
  targets::tar_load(schedule_ical_file)
})

show_table <- function(group_id) {
  # Add a heading
  cat(as.character(paste("\n\n###", schedule_nested$group[[group_id]], "\n\n")))
  
  # Make the table
  tbl <- schedule_nested$data[[group_id]] %>% 
    select(-subgroup) %>% 
    kbl(escape = FALSE, align = "rlccc", table.attr = 'class="schedule-table"') %>% 
    kable_styling() %>% 
    column_spec(1, width = "20%", extra_css = "padding-right: 20px;") %>% 
    column_spec(2, width = "50%") %>% 
    column_spec(3:5, width = "10%") %>% 
    pack_rows(index = schedule_nested$subgroup_index[[group_id]],
              label_row_css = "border-bottom: 2px solid #000000;")
  
  cat(tbl)
}
```

```{r show-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
walk(seq(1, nrow(schedule_nested)), ~show_table(.x))
