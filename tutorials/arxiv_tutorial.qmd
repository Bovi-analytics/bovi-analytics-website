![Submit button location](tutorials/images/arxiv-08-submit-button.png)

### 3.2 Choose Submission Type

Select whether you're submitting a new paper or replacing/updating an existing one. For your first submission, choose "START NEW SUBMISSION."

### 3.3 Understand arXiv Licenses

Before you proceed with the submission, it's important to understand the license options available. You'll need to choose a license later in the process, so familiarizing yourself with the options now will help you make an informed decision.

![Licensing Statement](tutorials/images/Licensing Statement.png)

#### License Options Explained:

##### 1. arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license to distribute (Default)

This is the standard arXiv license. Under this license:

- You grant arXiv a perpetual, non-exclusive right to distribute your work
- You retain copyright and all other rights to your work
- You can publish the paper elsewhere, including in journals
- You can make the paper available on your own website
- Others can read and download your paper, but cannot redistribute or reuse it without permission
- **Best for:** Most academic papers, especially if you plan to publish in a journal later

##### 2. Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY 4.0)

This is the most permissive Creative Commons license:

- Anyone can share, copy, and redistribute your work in any format
- Anyone can adapt, remix, transform, and build upon your work for any purpose, even commercially
- They must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made
- **Best for:** Papers where you want maximum dissemination and reuse, including commercial applications

##### 3. Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA 4.0)

Similar to CC BY, but with an additional requirement:

- Same permissions as CC BY
- If someone remixes or builds upon your work, they must distribute their contributions under the same CC BY-SA license
- This creates a "copyleft" effect, ensuring derivatives remain open
- **Best for:** Papers where you want to ensure derivative works remain freely available

##### 4. Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)

More restrictive than CC BY-SA:

- Similar to CC BY-SA, but prohibits commercial use
- Others can share and adapt your work for non-commercial purposes only
- They must give credit and license their derivatives under the same terms
- **Best for:** Papers where you want to prevent commercial exploitation while allowing academic reuse

##### 5. Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)

The most permissive option:

- You waive all copyright and related rights to your work
- Anyone can use your work for any purpose without restrictions
- No attribution is legally required (though it's academically expected)
- **Best for:** Data papers, methodological papers, or work you want to dedicate to the public domain

::: {.callout-important}
## Choosing Your License

Consider these factors when selecting a license:

1. **Journal requirements:** Some journals require certain licenses or may not accept papers under specific Creative Commons licenses. Check journal policies before choosing.

2. **Future publications:** If you plan to publish in a traditional journal later, the default arXiv license is usually safest.

3. **Reuse intentions:** If you want others to build upon your work freely, consider CC BY or CC BY-SA.

4. **Commercial concerns:** If you're concerned about commercial use of your work, consider CC BY-NC-SA.

5. **Collaboration:** Discuss with all co-authors before selecting a license, as all authors must agree.

**When in doubt, use the default arXiv license.** It's the most conservative option and won't interfere with future publication plans.

## Important Notes About Replacements

- Only the original submitter can submit replacements
- Previous versions remain accessible (arXiv maintains a complete version history)
- The arXiv identifier stays the same (e.g., arXiv:2501.12345v2 for version 2)
- Replacements go through the same moderation process
- You should explain changes in the comments to help readers understand what's different
:::

### 9.3 Version History

arXiv maintains a complete version history. Readers can:

- See all versions of your paper
- Compare versions to see what changed
- Cite specific versions if needed

This transparency is a feature, not a bug—it shows the evolution of your research.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### LaTeX Compilation Errors

**Problem:** Your LaTeX files don't compile on arXiv's servers.

**Solutions:**

- Ensure all necessary files are included (figures, `.bbl` file, style files)
- Test compilation locally with a standard LaTeX distribution
- Use standard packages that are available on arXiv
- Remove any custom paths, system-specific commands, or `\input` statements pointing to non-included files
- Check the arXiv TeX/LaTeX help page for the list of available packages

### PDF Processing Issues

**Problem:** Your PDF is rejected or displays incorrectly.

**Solutions:**

- Ensure all fonts are embedded (use `pdffonts` command to check)
- Remove any security restrictions or passwords from the PDF
- Make sure the PDF is searchable (not a scanned image)
- Reduce file size by compressing images if it exceeds 50 MB
- Use PDF/A format if possible for better archival quality

### Metadata Errors

**Problem:** You made a mistake in the title, authors, or abstract.

**Solutions:**

- If caught before announcement: Contact arXiv moderators immediately to request changes
- If caught after announcement: Submit a replacement version with corrected metadata
- For author list errors: Contact arXiv admin as author list changes require special handling

### Submission Delayed or On Hold

**Problem:** Your submission is delayed or placed on hold.

**Possible reasons:**

- The paper doesn't meet arXiv's scope or standards
- There are technical issues with your files
- Additional review is needed

**What to do:**

- Check your email for messages from arXiv moderators
- Respond promptly to any requests for information

### Can't Find Your Paper After Publication

**Problem:** Your paper was announced but you can't find it.

**Solutions:**

- Search using your exact name as it appears in the author list
- Use the arXiv identifier from your confirmation email
- Check the correct category—papers are listed in their primary category
- Clear your browser cache and try again
- Check that you're looking at the correct announcement date

## Best Practices

### Before Submission

1. **Proofread carefully**: Have co-authors review the final version
2. **Test your files**: Compile LaTeX locally or check PDF rendering
3. **Verify metadata**: Double-check all author names, affiliations, and abstract
4. **Check journal policies**: Ensure arXiv submission won't conflict with journal requirements
5. **Choose timing wisely**: Submit early in the week if you want faster publication

### During Submission

1. **Choose categories carefully**: Select the most appropriate primary category
2. **Write a clear abstract**: Make it accessible to readers outside your specific subfield
3. **Add helpful comments**: Include page count, submission status, and related work
4. **Select the right license**: Discuss with co-authors and consider future plans
5. **Review thoroughly**: This is your last chance to catch errors before going public

### After Submission

1. **Save confirmation emails**: Keep records of your submission ID and dates
2. **Monitor for publication**: Check for your announcement email
3. **Share appropriately**: Once published, share on social media and with colleagues
4. **Track citations**: Monitor how your paper is cited and referenced
5. **Respond to feedback**: Consider feedback from readers for future versions

### For Replacements

1. **Document changes**: Clearly explain what you changed in the comments
2. **Don't over-revise**: Only submit replacements for substantive changes
3. **Consider timing**: Wait until you have multiple fixes rather than many small updates
4. **Maintain quality**: Replacements should improve the paper, not rush out incomplete fixes
