## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### LaTeX Compilation Errors

If your LaTeX doesn't compile:

- Ensure all necessary files are included
- Check that you're using standard packages
- Remove any custom paths or system-specific commands
- Test your files locally before uploading

### PDF Processing Issues

If your PDF is rejected:

- Ensure fonts are embedded
- Remove any security restrictions
- Make sure the PDF is searchable (not a scanned image)
- Reduce file size if it exceeds limits

### Endorsement Delays

If you're waiting for endorsement:

- Contact colleagues who are established arXiv authors
- Provide them with your arXiv user ID and desired category
- Check that your email address is correctly registered

## Best Practices

1. **Prepare files carefully**: Test LaTeX compilation locally before submission
2. **Double-check metadata**: Ensure all author names, affiliations, and the abstract are accurate
3. **Choose categories wisely**: Select the most appropriate primary category and relevant cross-lists
4. **Include helpful comments**: Add information about page count, submission status, or related papers
5. **Use proper licenses**: Understand the license options and choose appropriately
6. **Plan timing**: Submit early in the week if you want faster publication
7. **Keep records**: Save your submission ID and confirmation emails
