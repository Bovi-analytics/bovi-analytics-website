It was a five-year project from 2014 and 2018 executed by 15 research and industry partners. The project covered the interaction between genotype and environment contributing to the sustainability of dairy cow production systems. This was achieved through the optimal integration of genomic selection and novel management protocols based on the development and exploitation of genomic data and supporting novel phenotyping approaches.\n€9.000.000\n\n\nDECIDE, is a five-year Horizon 2020 project running from 2021 to 2025. It will develop data-driven decision support tools that offer robust and early signals of disease emergence and options for diagnostic confirmation. Moreover, options will be provided for controlling the disease along with their implications in terms of disease spread, economic burden and animal welfare.\n€10.000.000\n\n\nIn the SUMMERFAIR project (SUMmarizing ducationial transmission data to Enable data Reanalysis and predictions by FAIR data use) we tackle the issue of lack of a common terminology and need for repetition of costly experiments by developing a shared vocabulary (domain-ontology) and a workflow enabling reuse and combination of transmission data. The project running from 2021-2022 was granted by the dutch ZoNMW.\n€250.000\n\n\nVEERKRACHT/Resilience – The transition period as a window and metabolic resilience to monitor of dairy cattle, granted by national Belgian VLAIO 2018 is a project that aims at creating tools to monitor the transition success of dairy cows at individual level and herd level. These tools allow the farmer to monitor individual animals at risk, in addition to allow individualized preventive measures. This will reduce the development of transition associated problems, which will increase productivity and animal welfare.\n€1.300.000\n\n\nIn 2014 and 2018, I was twice awarded a Microsoft Azure for Research grant of €150k and €25k to incorporate machine learning techniques in monitoring sustainable agriculture practices.\n€175.000\n\n\nApplied data science award from the Utrecht University to create the first LoraWAN network at the faculty of Veterinary Medicine.\n€5.000"
